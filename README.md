];
```

## Usage
The package resources can be published to your Laravel applicationâ€™s default structure as needed.

## Publish All Resources
To publish all available resources (models, migrations, seeders, and factories), run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rohith\AdminPackage\AdminPanelServiceProvider"
```

## Selective Publishing
Use the following commands to publish specific resources:

Publish Assets:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=admin-panel-assets
```
Publish Views:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=admin-panel-views
```
