];
```

## Publish All Resources
To publish all available resources (models, migrations, seeders, and factories), run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rohith\AdminPackage\AdminPanelServiceProvider"
```

## Selective Publishing
Use the following commands to publish specific resources:

Publish Models:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=ecommerce-models
```
